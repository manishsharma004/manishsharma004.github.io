Well, it depends. There are different types of interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s the classic algorithmic coding interview, sometimes called the &ldquo;Google-style whiteboard interview.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s focused on data structures and algorithms (queues and stacks, binary search, etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what our full course prepares you for. It&#39;s how the big players interview. <a href=\"/explore/interview/card/google/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, <a href=\"/explore/interview/card/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"/explore/interview/card/amazon/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"/explore/interview/card/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>, Oracle, LinkedIn, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For startups and smaller shops, it&rsquo;s a mixed bag. Most will ask at least a few algorithmic questions. But they might also include some role-specific stuff, like Java questions or SQL questions for a backend web engineer. They&rsquo;ll be especially interested in your ability to ship code without much direction. You might end up doing a code test or pair-programming exercise instead of a whiteboarding session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure you study for the right stuff, you should ask your recruiter what to expect. Send an email with a question like, &ldquo;Is this interview going to cover data structures and algorithms? Or will it be more focused around coding in X language.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll be happy to tell you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you you&#39;ve never learned about data structures and algorithms, or you&#39;re feeling a little rusty, check out our Intuitive Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper --></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Which programming language should I use?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies usually let you choose, in which case you should use your most comfortable language. If you know a bunch of languages, prefer one that lets you express more with fewer characters and fewer lines of code, like Python or Ruby. It keeps your whiteboard cleaner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to stick with the same language for the whole interview, but sometimes you might want to switch languages for a question. E.g., processing a file line by line will be far easier in Python than in C++.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, though, your interviewer will do this thing where they have a pet question that&rsquo;s, for example, C-specific. If you list C on your resume, they&rsquo;ll ask it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So keep that in mind! If you&rsquo;re not confident with a language, make that clear on your resume. Put your less-strong languages under a header like &lsquo;Working Knowledge.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper --></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>What should I wear?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to dress a tiny step above what people normally wear to the office.

A fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Impostor syndrome is like kryptonite to coding interviews.</strong> It makes you give up and go silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might stop asking clarifying questions because you&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll sound too basic.

Whole <em>disciplines</em> like machine learning, theory of computation, and embedded systems. Things you can&#39;t just pick up in an afternoon. Heavy bodies of knowledge that take <em>months</em> to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the universe of things you <em>could</em> know seems to keep expanding faster and faster&mdash;much faster than your tiny sliver of knowledge is growing. It feels like you&#39;ll never be able to keep up.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\" id=\"everyone-else-knows\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>What everyone <em>else</em> knows</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s another common cognitive bias: we assume that because something is easy for us, it must be easy for everyone else. So when we look at our own skills, we assume they&#39;re not unique. But when we look at <em>other</em> people&#39;s skills, we notice the skills they have that we don&#39;t have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result? We think everyone&rsquo;s knowledge is a superset of our own:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"Three circles: one big, one medium, and one small.

An area you&#39;re probably blind to, because you&#39;re so focused on the stuff you don&#39;t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"aside\">We&rsquo;ve all had flashes of realizing this. For me, it was seeing the back end code wizard on my team&mdash;the one that always made me feel like an impostor&mdash;spend an hour trying to center an image on a webpage.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" id=\"your-rare-strengths\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>It&#39;s a problem of focus</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on what you don&#39;t know causes you to underestimate what you <em>do</em> know. And that&#39;s what causes impostor syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By looking at the vast (and <em>expanding</em>) universe of things you <em>could</em> know, you feel like you hardly know anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And by looking at what Aysha and Bruno know that you don&#39;t know, you feel like you&#39;re a step behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And interviews make you <em>really</em> focus on what you don&#39;t know. You focus on what could go wrong. The knowledge gaps your interviewers might find. The questions you might not know how to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But remember:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because Aysha and Bruno know some things you don&#39;t know, doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t also know things Aysha and Bruno don&#39;t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And more importantly, <em>everyone&#39;s</em> body of knowledge is just a teeny-tiny sliver of everything they could learn. We <em>all</em> have gaps in our knowledge. We <em>all</em> have interview questions we won&#39;t be able to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re not a step behind. You just have a lot of stuff you don&#39;t know yet.

Another company you&#39;ve been talking to for a while sends you an &ldquo;exploding offer&rdquo;&mdash;an offer that expires in a week or even 24 hours. You have to respond to the exploding offer before your final round of interviews at the first company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t wanna have to decide between a real offer and a potential offer.</strong> Either decision has a big downside:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you accept the offer in front of you, you&rsquo;re moving forward with a nagging &ldquo;What if?&rdquo;&mdash;especially if you were excited about the other company.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you reject the real offer, it&#39;s possible the other company won&#39;t end up extending you an offer in the end. You could end up with nothing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also bad for negotiation. The best way to get negotiating leverage with one company is to have an offer from another company. If your offers aren&#39;t open at the same time, you lose that leverage.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Work backwards from a signing date</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So you want to do everything you can to ensure your offers come in at the same time. But how do you do that? The key is to work backwards:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pick a &quot;signing date&quot; and stick to it.</strong> This is the date that you plan to make a final decision and sign an offer. This includes some allowed time for <em>negotiating</em> once you have all your offers in hand (more on that later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share your chosen signing date with every company as soon as you start talking to them. You may even want to ask them to <em>confirm</em> that they&#39;ll be able to work with your timeline. This way a company is much less likely to give you an offer that explodes before that date&mdash;they already know your timeline, so if they can&#39;t work with it they should tell you up front.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"aside\">\r\n<p>What if a company <em>does</em> give you an offer that explodes before your signing date, even though you told them about it early on? Don&#39;t panic. Politely remind them that you&#39;ve been clear about your timeline from the beginning. Explain that you&#39;d like to make your final decision on the date you&#39;ve already shared with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they still won&#39;t budge, you might be better off passing on that company&mdash;if they&#39;re comfortable squeezing you this early on in your relationship, that&#39;s a bad sign for how they&#39;d treat you as an employee.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, some companies have policies about not having open offers for more than X days. So what if you&#39;re going through the interview process with one of those companies and it looks like you&#39;re moving too fast and the offer would come in too early and explode before the signing date you chose?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No problem. Most companies are happy to &quot;pause&quot; or slow down your interview process so the offer comes in later. This way both parties can get what they want: the company can follow their usual &quot;offers explode after X days&quot; policy, and you can have the offer still open on your pre-planned signing date.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>How far out should my signing date be?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It depends. At a high level, you should <strong>allow as much time as you can afford to</strong>. Most people underestimate how long their job search is going to take. And when you end up in a time crunch at the end, it means less time at the negotiation stage. So allowing an extra week for your job search could literally mean earning tens of thousands of dollars more in your final salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a current job or are a full-time student, try to allow more time by starting the process earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, some of us will be in situations where we really need to start our new job as soon as possible. That&#39;s fine. Do what works for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that you&rsquo;re shooting for having enough time to practice and get through the whole interview process with multiple companies if you can. Think through how much time you can devote to each of these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Studying (1&ndash;8 weeks)</li>\r\n\t<li>Phone screens (1&ndash;3 weeks)</li>\r\n\t<li>Onsites (1&ndash;3 weeks)</li>\r\n\t<li>Negotiation (1&ndash;2 weeks)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"aside\">\r\n<p>One more consideration: if you have the means, <strong>consider leaving yourself some time for a vacation before starting your new job</strong>. Job hunting is stressful. And that window of time between signing a new offer and starting a new job can be a rare window of low stress and low responsibility in your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many companies are happy to accommodate this by setting your start date a few weeks after your signing date&mdash;just ask. Many offers include a signing bonus, which could help offset the cost of this extra time without a salary. But again, this&#39;ll depend on your means&mdash;not everyone can afford to take this extra time off.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Cast A Wide Net</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with multiple companies.</strong> Exactly how many companies depends on your situation, but the point is to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. You want multiple offers by the end, so you can negotiate the best offer possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good rule of thumb: send out applications to more places than you&rsquo;re currently planning. If you end up getting too many interviews&hellip;well that&rsquo;s a good problem to have! You can always &quot;pause&quot; or simply cancel the interview process with some companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schedule your favorite companies last.</strong> Get interview practice with the places you aren&rsquo;t as excited about. You&rsquo;ll be in your prime by the time you interview with your top choices, so long as you don&rsquo;t burn out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jot down your impressions after each interview.</strong> You&rsquo;ll be surprised how much different companies can start to melt together after a couple weeks of interviewing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Avoid Burnout</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re casting a wide net and allowing several weeks for your job search, you need to be careful about burnout.

Maybe it was your 10<sup>th</sup> grade English teacher. Maybe it was career services in college. &ldquo;Remember: <em>show</em>, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&rsquo;s good advice. When it comes to answering behavioral questions (like &ldquo;Tell me about yourself&rdquo;) in coding interviews, the difference between a good answer and a <em>great</em> answer comes down to <em>showing</em> rather than telling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is, people who give you the advice of &ldquo;Show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo;&hellip; are <em>themselves</em> failing to follow it. They&rsquo;re <em>telling</em> you to show, but they should be <em>showing</em> you <em>how to show</em>. That&rsquo;s the hardest part!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here are three specific tips for showing more and telling less.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\" id=\"storytelling-tell-me-about-yourself\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>1. Sprinkle in specific details</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine two responses to the stock interview question &ldquo;Tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I started programming about two years ago with some personal projects. I eventually got a job at a small tech company in my home town, and I&rsquo;ve been working there about a year and a half. I like my job, but I&rsquo;m looking for a new challenge, which I think your company could provide.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Then:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I got started programming because I wanted to build a social network for cats. That didn&rsquo;t take off, but the prototype helped me get a job at a small tech company in my home town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, I read an awesome article on Hacker News about the social network your company is building. The scaling challenges you face seem like they&rsquo;ll help me grow faster and stronger than my current role will.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The second response says <em>a lot</em> more about the candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because of the <em>specific details</em>. An interviewer won&rsquo;t remember the tenth person to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a new challenge.&rdquo; They <em>will</em> remember the person who tried to build a social network for cats and read about their company on Hacker News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So don&rsquo;t skimp on the details. <strong>Look out for opportunities to use specifics</strong>, especially if they&rsquo;re at all quirky, funny, surprising, or otherwise <em>memorable</em>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" id=\"storytelling-why-work-here\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>2. Tell a story from your life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Take another common question: &ldquo;Why do you want to work here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People tend to just cross-reference their values with those of the company or team they&rsquo;re interviewing with:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in technical blogging and open source. So I like that your company has some open-source work and contributes back to the community.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fine response. But to really wow your interviewer, try adding a specific story around those values:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>A couple years ago, when I was still new to programming, I was working on this tricky bug. I found a post on a company blog where an engineer explained how her team solved the issue. She included a code snippet she&rsquo;d open-sourced. I appreciated that she took the time to write about her team&rsquo;s experience and share their solution. It helped me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s how I first started getting into open source. I really wanna work with more engineers like that&mdash;who write about their work and try to help others in the community. So I was excited to see all the stuff your team shares on your blog and on the company&rsquo;s Github profile.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The second response just sounds more genuine. It <em>shows</em> a personal connection to open source and technical blogging, instead of just <em>telling</em> it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone can look up a company&rsquo;s core values and repeat them during an interview. It&rsquo;s more meaningful to <strong>tell a story from your life</strong> that shows how those values benefited you or taught you something.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\" id=\"storytelling-greatest-strength\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>3. Use someone else&rsquo;s voice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This one&rsquo;s a neat trick. Consider one more standard behavioral question: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest strength?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might tell the interviewer:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I work well with others. Even under tough circumstances, I make sure my coworkers feel supported.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>But a lightly detailed story is better suited to show this strength:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I have a coworker, Ana, who&rsquo;s been an engineer for almost a decade. We worked together on this really tough, messy project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end, she told me, &ldquo;For such a hellish project, you really made things feel sane.&rdquo; I think this is my biggest strength&mdash;I work well with others, even under tough circumstances.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>When you respond with a story, you can <strong>refer to what <em>other</em> people have said about your best qualities</strong>. In this case, a ten-year tech veteran said you made a project feel less awful. That kind of praise is a lot more credible when it comes from someone else.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" id=\"storytelling-practice\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Practice, practice, practice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember these specific tricks for showing rather than telling:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Use specific, memorable details</strong>. &ldquo;Social network for cats&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a personal project.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Tell a story from your life</strong>. &ldquo;I was trying to solve a tricky bug&hellip;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I value open source contributions.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Use someone else&rsquo;s voice</strong>. &ldquo;&rsquo;You really made things feel sane&lsquo;&rdquo; instead of &quot;I work well with others.&quot;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Try these tactics out on the questions below.

They&#39;re looking for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Metacognition about coding</strong>. Do you think about how to code well?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ownership/leadership</strong>. Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren&#39;t quite right, even if you don&#39;t have to?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Communication</strong>. Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You should have at least one:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>example of an interesting technical problem you solved</li>\r\n\t<li>example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame</li>\r\n\t<li>example of leadership or ownership</li>\r\n\t<li>story about what you should have done differently in a past project</li>\r\n\t<li>piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don&#39;t like about said language</li>\r\n\t<li>question about the company&#39;s product/business</li>\r\n\t<li>question about the company&#39;s engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nerd out about stuff</strong>. Show you&#39;re proud of what you&#39;ve done, you&#39;re amped about what they&#39;re doing, and you have opinions about languages and workflows.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\" id=\"communicate\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Communicate.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you get into the coding questions, communication is key. A candidate who needed some help along the way but communicated clearly can be even better than a candidate who breezed through the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understand what kind of problem it is</strong>. There are two types of problems:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Coding</strong>. The interviewer wants to see you write clean, efficient code for a problem.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Chitchat</strong>. The interviewer just wants you to talk about something. These questions are often either (1) high-level system design (&quot;How would you build a Twitter clone?&quot;) or (2) trivia (&quot;What is hoisting in Javascript?&quot;). Sometimes the trivia is a lead-in for a &quot;real&quot; question e.g., &quot;How quickly can we sort <span class=\"ic-words ng-isolate-scope\" ng-transclude=\"\" words=\"article__coding-interview-tips__a-standard-list\"><span class=\"ng-scope\">a list</span></span> of integers? Good, now suppose instead of integers we had . . .&quot;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you start writing code and the interviewer just wanted a quick chitchat answer before moving on to the &quot;real&quot; question, they&#39;ll get frustrated. Just ask, &quot;Should we write code for this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make it feel like you&#39;re on a team</strong>. The interviewer wants to know what it feels like to work through a problem with you, so make the interview feel collaborative. Use &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I,&quot; as in, &quot;If we did a breadth-first search we&#39;d get an answer in <span class=\"ng-isolate-scope\" complexity=\"n\"><span class=\"complexity\"><span class=\"ic-math ng-isolate-scope\" math=\"\" ng-class=\"{'block': isBlock()}\" ng-transclude=\"\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base textstyle uncramped\"><span class=\"mord mathit\" style=\"margin-right: 0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">n</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> time.&quot; If you get to choose between coding on paper and coding on a whiteboard, always choose the whiteboard. That way you&#39;ll be situated next to the interviewer, facing the problem (rather than across from her at a table).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think out loud.</strong> Seriously. Say, &quot;Let&#39;s try doing it this way&mdash;not sure yet if it&#39;ll work.&quot; If you&#39;re stuck, just say what you&#39;re thinking. Say what might work. Say what you thought could work and why it doesn&#39;t work. This also goes for trivial chitchat questions. When asked to explain Javascript closures, &quot;It&#39;s something to do with scope and putting stuff in a <span class=\"ic-words ng-isolate-scope\" ng-transclude=\"\" words=\"article__coding-interview-tips__function\"><span class=\"ng-scope\">function</span></span>&quot; will probably get you 90% credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Say you don&#39;t know.</strong> If you&#39;re touching on a <em>fact</em> (e.g., language-specific trivia, a hairy bit of runtime analysis), don&#39;t try to appear to know something you don&#39;t. Instead, say &quot;<em>I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;d guess $thing, because...</em>&quot;. The <em>because</em> can involve ruling out other options by showing they have nonsensical implications, or pulling examples from other languages or other problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slow the eff down</strong>. Don&#39;t confidently blurt out an answer right away. If it&#39;s right you&#39;ll still have to explain it, and if it&#39;s wrong you&#39;ll seem reckless. You don&#39;t win anything for speed and you&#39;re more likely to annoy your interviewer by cutting her off or appearing to jump to conclusions.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" id=\"unstuck\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Get unstuck.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes you&#39;ll get stuck. Relax. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve failed. Keep in mind that the interviewer usually cares more about your ability to cleverly poke the problem from a few different angles than your ability to stumble into the correct answer. When hope seems lost, keep poking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Draw pictures.</strong> Don&#39;t waste time trying to think in your head&mdash;think on the board. Draw a couple different test inputs. Draw how you would get the desired output by hand. Then think about translating your approach into code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Solve a simpler version of the problem.</strong> Not sure how to find the 4th largest item in the set? Think about how to find the 1st largest item and see if you can adapt that approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Write a naive, inefficient solution and optimize it later.</strong> Use brute force. Do whatever it takes to get <em>some kind</em> of answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think out loud more</strong>. Say what you know. Say what you thought might work and why it won&#39;t work. You might realize it actually does work, or a modified version does. Or you might get a hint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wait for a hint.</strong> Don&#39;t stare at your interviewer expectantly, but do take a <em>brief</em> second to &quot;think&quot;&mdash;your interviewer might have already decided to give you a hint and is just waiting to avoid interrupting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think about the bounds on space and runtime.</strong> If you&#39;re not sure if you can optimize your solution, think about it out loud.

But the clock is ticking, and you don&rsquo;t have Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You just have an empty whiteboard, a smelly marker, and an interviewer who&rsquo;s looking at you expectantly. And all you can think about is how stuck you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need a lifeline for these moments&mdash;like a little box that says &ldquo;In Case of Emergency, Break Glass.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Inside</em> that glass box? A list of tricks for getting unstuck. Here&rsquo;s that list of tricks.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\" id=\"unstuck-design\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>When you&rsquo;re stuck on getting started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Write a sample input on the whiteboard and turn it into the correct output &quot;by hand.&quot;</strong> Notice the <em>process</em> you use. Look for patterns, and think about how to implement your process in code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to reverse a string? Write &ldquo;hello&rdquo; on the board. Reverse it &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;&mdash;draw arrows from each character&rsquo;s current position to its desired position.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"An array containing the string &quot;hello.&quot; Arrows are drawn to show the swapping of the first letter with the last letter, the second letter with the second to last letter, and the middle letter with itself.\" height=\"97\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/unstuck__hello_string.svg?bust=173\" width=\"221\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the pattern: it looks like we&rsquo;re <em>swapping</em> pairs of characters, starting from the outside and moving in. Now we&rsquo;re halfway to an algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Solve a simpler version of the problem.</strong> Remove or simplify one of the requirements of the problem. Once you have a solution, see if you can adapt that approach for the original question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to find the k-largest element in a set? Walk through finding the <em>largest</em> element, then the <em>second largest</em>, then the <em>third largest</em>. Generalizing from there to find the k-largest isn&rsquo;t so bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Start with an inefficient solution.</strong> Even if it feels <em>stupidly inefficient</em>, it&rsquo;s often helpful to start with <em>something</em> that&rsquo;ll return the right answer. From there, you just have to <a href=\"#unstuck-optimization\">optimize</a> your solution. Explain to your interviewer that this is only your first idea, and that you suspect there are faster solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose you were given two lists of sorted numbers and asked to find the median of both lists combined. It&rsquo;s messy, but you could simply:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Concatenate the arrays together into a new array.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sort the new array.</li>\r\n\t<li>Return the value at the middle index.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"aside\">\r\n<p>Notice that you could&rsquo;ve <em>also</em> arrived at this algorithm by using trick (2): Solve a simpler version of the problem. &ldquo;How would I find the median of <em>one</em> sorted list of numbers? Just grab the item at the middle index. Now, can I adapt that approach for getting the median of <em>two</em> sorted lists?&rdquo;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /.section --></div>\r\n<!-- /.section-wrapper -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" id=\"unstuck-optimization\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>When you&rsquo;re stuck on finding optimizations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Look for repeat work.</strong> If your current solution goes through the same data multiple times, you&rsquo;re doing unnecessary repeat work. See if you can save time by looking through the data just once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say that inside one of your loops, there&rsquo;s a brute-force operation to find an element in an array. You&rsquo;re repeatedly looking through items that you don&rsquo;t have to. Instead, you could convert the array to a lookup table to dramatically improve your runtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Look for hints in the specifics of the problem.</strong> Is the input array sorted? Is the <a href=\"/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/\" target=\"_blank\">binary tree</a> balanced? Details like this can carry huge hints about the solution. If it didn&rsquo;t matter, your interviewer wouldn&rsquo;t have brought it up. It&rsquo;s a strong sign that the best solution to the problem exploits it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re asked to find the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array. The fact that the array is <em>sorted</em> is a strong hint&mdash;take advantage of that fact by using a <a href=\"/explore/learn/card/binary-search/\" target=\"_blank\">binary search</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"aside\">Sometimes interviewers leave the question deliberately vague because they want you to <em>ask questions</em> to unearth these important tidbits of context. So ask some questions at the beginning of the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Throw some data structures at the problem.</strong> Can you save time by using the fast lookups of a <a href=\"/explore/learn/card/hash-table/\" target=\"_blank\">hash table</a>? Can you express the relationships between data points as a <a href=\"/problemset/all/?topicSlugs=graph\" target=\"_blank\">graph</a>? Look at the requirements of the problem and ask yourself if there&rsquo;s a data structure that has those properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Establish bounds on space and runtime.</strong> Think <em>out loud</em> about the parameters of the problem. Try to get a sense for how fast your algorithm <em>could possibly</em> be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;I have to at least look at all the items, so I can&rsquo;t do better than <span class=\"ng-isolate-scope\" concept=\"big-o-learn-more\"><span class=\"concept-wrapper\" ng-init=\"showConcept=false\"> <span class=\"concept\" ng-click=\"showConcept=!showConcept\"> <span class=\"concept-name\" ng-transclude=\"\"><span class=\"ng-scope ng-isolate-scope\" complexity=\"n\"><span class=\"complexity\"><span class=\"ic-math ng-isolate-scope\" math=\"\" ng-class=\"{'block': isBlock()}\" ng-transclude=\"\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base textstyle uncramped\"><span class=\"mord mathit\" style=\"margin-right: 0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">n</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </span> <!-- ngInclude: conceptPartialUrl --></span></span>\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"slide concept-explanation ng-scope ng-hide\" ng-include=\"conceptPartialUrl\" ng-show=\"showConcept\" style=\"\">\r\n\t<div class=\"ng-scope\">\r\n\t<p><span class=\"ng-isolate-scope\" concept=\"big-o-learn-more\"><span class=\"concept-wrapper\" ng-init=\"showConcept=false\">Not sure what this is?

After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you&#39;ve came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you&#39;re cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What if we thought of the problem this way?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You feel a tension we&#39;ve all felt during the coding interview:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>&quot;Try to listen to what they&#39;re saying...but don&#39;t lose your train of thought...ugh, I can&#39;t do both!&quot; </strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a make-or-break moment in the coding interview. And so many people get it wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most candidates end up only half understanding what their interviewer is saying. Because they&#39;re only half listening. Because they&#39;re desperately clinging to their train of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&#39;s easy to see why. For many of us, completely losing track of what we&#39;re doing is one of our <em>biggest</em> coding interview fears. So we devote half of our mental energy to clinging to our train of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand why that&#39;s so wrong, we need to understand the difference between what <em>we</em> see during the coding interview and what <em>our interviewer</em> sees.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>The programming interview maze</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Working on a coding interview question is like walking through a giant maze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&#39;t know anything about the shape of the maze until you start wandering around it. You might know vaguely where the solution is, but you don&#39;t know how to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"A maze with a mouse at one corner labeled &quot;You&quot; and a piece of cheese at the opposite corner labeled &quot;An Answer.&quot; Only a small section of the maze directly surrounding the mouse is revealed, showing two possible paths to the cheese.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_start.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As you wander through the maze, you might find a promising path (an approach, a way to break down the problem). You might follow that path for a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"The same maze with the mouse further along, nearing the cheese.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_first_path.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, your interviewer suggests a different path:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"Now the mouse has turned around in the same spot, and an arrow points the mouse back towards the beginning of the maze to a new path.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_new_path.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>But from what you can see so far of the maze, your approach has already gotten you halfway there! Losing your place on your current path would mean a huge step backwards. Or so it seems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>That&#39;s</em> why people hold onto their train of thought instead of listening to their interviewer. Because from what they can see, it looks like they&#39;re getting somewhere!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here&#39;s the thing: <strong>your interviewer knows the whole maze</strong>. They&#39;ve asked this question 100 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"aside\">I&#39;m not exaggerating: if you interview candidates for a year, you can easily end up asking the same question over 100 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if your interviewer is suggesting a certain path, you can bet it leads to an answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"Following the new path, the mouse has made it to the cheese at the end of the maze.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_completed.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>And your seemingly great path? There&#39;s probably a dead end just ahead that you haven&#39;t seen yet:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"Now the entirety of the maze is revealed, showing that the mouse's original path through the maze led to a dead end.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_dead_end.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Or it could just be a much longer route to a solution than you think it is. That actually happens pretty often&mdash;there&#39;s an answer there, but it&#39;s more complicated than you think.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"diagram \"><img alt=\"Again the maze is revealed, showing an alternate scenario in which the mouse's original path eventually led to the cheese but in a much more complicated way.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/fog_of_war__maze_complicated_path.svg?bust=173\" width=\"275\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Hitting a dead end is okay. Failing to listen is not.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your interviewer probably won&#39;t <em>fault</em> you for going down the wrong path at first. They&#39;ve seen really smart engineers do the same thing. They understand it&#39;s because you only have a partial view of the maze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They might have let you go down the wrong path for a bit to see if you could keep your thinking organized without help. But now they want to rush you through the part where you discover the dead end and double back. Not because they don&#39;t believe you can manage it yourself. But because they want to make sure you have enough time to finish the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here&#39;s something they <em>will</em> fault you for: failing to listen to them. Nobody wants to work with an engineer who doesn&#39;t listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when you find yourself in that crucial coding interview moment, when you&#39;re torn between holding your train of thought and considering the idea your interviewer is suggesting...remember this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Listening to your interviewer is the <em>most</em> important thing. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take what they&#39;re saying and run with it. Think of the next steps that follow from what they&#39;re saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if it means completely leaving behind the path you were on. Trust the route your interviewer is pointing you down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because they can see the whole maze.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"line\" />\r\n<div>by <a href=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/?utm_source=leetcode\" onclick=\"window.ga &amp;&amp; ga('send', 'event', 'interview-cake', 'click', 'interview-cake'); return true;\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"20\" id=\"provider-logo\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3-lc-upload/explore/custom-css/interviewcake.png\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><a class=\"original-link\" href=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/why-youre-hitting-dead-ends-in-whiteboard-interviews?utm_source=leetcode\" onclick=\"window.ga &amp;&amp; ga('send', 'event', 'interview-cake', 'click', 'original-post-dead-ends'); return true;\" target=\"_blank\">View Original Post</a></div>\r\n</div>",

You&rsquo;ll naturally wanna brush up on technical questions. But <em>how</em> you practice those questions will make a big difference in how well you&rsquo;re prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;re a few tips to make sure you get the most out of your practice sessions.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Track your weak spots</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the hardest parts of practicing is knowing <em>what</em> to practice. Tracking what you struggle with helps answer that question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So grab a fresh notebook. After each question, look back and ask yourself, &ldquo;What did I get wrong about this problem at first?&rdquo; Take the time to write down one or two things you got stuck on, and what helped you figure them out. Compare these notes to our <a href=\"/explore/interview/card/coding-interview-strategy/207/chapter-2-the-heat-of-battle/1248/\">tips for getting unstuck</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After each full practice session, read through your <em>entire</em> running list. Read it at the beginning of each practice session too. This&rsquo;ll add a nice layer of rigor to your practice, so you&rsquo;re really internalizing the lessons you&rsquo;re learning.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Use an actual whiteboard</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Coding on a whiteboard is awkward at first. You have to write out every single character, and you can&rsquo;t easily insert or delete blocks of code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use your practice sessions to iron out that awkwardness. Run a few problems on a piece of paper or, if you can, a real whiteboard. A few helpful tips for handwriting code:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Start in the top-left corner.</strong> You want all the room you can get.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leave blank space between each line of code</strong>. This makes it <em>much</em> easier to add things later.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Slow down.</strong> Take an extra second to think of descriptive variable names. You might be tempted to move faster by using short variable names, but that actually ends up costing <em>more</em> time. It&rsquo;ll make your code harder to debug!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Set a timer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Get a feel for the time pressure of an actual interview. You should be able to finish a problem in 30&ndash;45 minutes, including debugging your code at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting out and the timer adds too much stress, put this technique on the shelf. Add it in later as you start to get more comfortable with solving problems.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Think out loud</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Like writing code on a whiteboard, this is an acquired skill. It feels awkward at first. But your interviewer will expect you to think out loud during the interview, so you gotta power through that awkwardness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good trick to get used to talking out loud: <strong>Grab a buddy.</strong> Another engineer would be great, but you can also do this with a non-technical friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have your buddy sit in while you talk through a problem. Better yet&mdash;try loading up one of our questions on an iPad and giving that to your buddy to use as a script!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section-wrapper shaded\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h2>Set aside a specific time of day to practice.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Give yourself an hour each day to practice. Commit to practicing around the same time, like after you eat dinner. This helps you form a stickier habit of practicing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prefer small, daily doses of practice to doing big cram sessions every once in a while.
