She will try to assess whether you will be a good fit for the role.</p><br/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><b>Best practice to answer: </b> First of all, this is a great opportunity to tell your story. For strengths, you can share the traits that led you to your greatest successes. For the developing areas, demonstrate yourself as a lifetime learner.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>With your biggest strength question, it is your opportunity to leave a lasting impression with the interviewer. The best way to approach this is through concrete stories. For example, if your top strength is taking initiatives, you should tell a compelling story where you have gone above and beyond using STAR framework. Please make sure your strength stands out in this story. Even if you think you are slightly better with strength A than strength B, but if you have a more compelling story with B, you should go with B. People do not remember what you say, they remember your stories.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>Ensure that your strengths are directly related to the role and set you apart from others. The weaknesses should be relayed in such a way that they do not have a fatal impact on your role. It&rsquo;s important to show that you have taken steps to improve.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>Sometimes, the interviewers only ask about weakness. Do not answer the question directly if you can. Share that you think strength and weakness are a great combo and ask the interviewer if you can talk about both. In most cases, the interviewer will happily agree and you will take the question to the course that is favorable to you. Of course, if the time is tight, answer the question directly, but again, emphasizing on your actions to improve.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>Even if you are not asked to share your strengths, try to find opportunities to share your stories of successes and make connection between the successes and your strengths.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><b>Common pitfalls:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Too shy to talk about what you are really good at. Do not be shy. The interviewers will not know your strengths if you do not tell them a compelling story. Before your interviews, get your strength story ready, sharp and concise.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>Do not pick up strengths that are entirely unrelated to the job. The interviewers are here to gather information to make hiring recommendations, not for pure entertainment. So pick up strengths that are important in a professional setting, such as your ability to learn, collaborate, execute, innovate, lead, etc.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>Ingenuine or clich&eacute;d weaknesses. A common example is that I work too hard. All interviewers know it is made up. Let us face it. We all have a few true weaknesses. Do not think your answer to this question is doomed to impact you negatively. Please have the coverage to make lemonade from a lemon. Turn this question into what you have learned about yourself and how you enriched your skills after you discovered the weakness. That will impress the interviewers a lot more, trust me.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><b>Question variations:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What do you wish to be better at?</li>\r\n\t<li>What are you most proud of?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"lp-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3-lc-upload/explore/cards/leap-ai/interview.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display:initial; margin: 10px 0 -20px 0\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"line\" />\r\n<div>by <a href=\"https://leap.ai/welcome?utm_source=leetcode&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=interview\" onclick=\"window.ga &amp;&amp; ga('send', 'event', 'leap-ai-explore', 'click', 'leap-ai'); return true;\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"20\" id=\"provider-logo\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3-lc-upload/explore/cards/leap-ai/leap.png\" /></a></div>",

One effective way to assess whether the job function matches with your passion is to have a deeper understanding of your motivation and values.

No matter whether you are a junior or a senior member, there are times you need to get others to support your plan. The other party could be in your team, in the cross-functional team on the same project, in another project team, or even outside your company. To effectively influence others, one has to communicate well and build trust with others. From your answer, the interviewers can easily tell whether you had experience influencing others. They will be assessing your answer with the following questions in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How difficult was the situation,</li>\r\n\t<li>How do you identify the right stakeholders to influence,</li>\r\n\t<li>How sophisticated were your tactics,</li>\r\n\t<li>How effective was your approach,</li>\r\n\t<li>How well you listened to others&rsquo; concern, and</li>\r\n\t<li>How creative you are to address others&rsquo; concern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"lp-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3-lc-upload/explore/cards/leap-ai/influencer.png\" style=\"max-width: 300px; width: 100%; display:initial; margin: 30px 0 35px 0\" /></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><b>Best practice to answer: </b> First of all, before the persuasion, demonstrate that you have a comprehensive picture of the topic you are trying to influence. Otherwise, you will lose your credibility with the stakeholders. This requires you to identify the right stakeholders and reach out to them, listen to them, capture relevant context, especially key stakeholders&rsquo; point of view. Secondly, identify the options and the tradeoff between different options, be open to discuss the options and choose the one that works the best for the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interview, explain clearly what you have done to identify the options, adjust your proposal based on input from the stakeholders, and drive everyone to agreement and commitment after the decision.

Too many details imply, you are trying too hard. For example, if you say you bring positive energy and fun to the team, you can give examples on how many team events you organize, either ad-hoc or planned, but no need to go into specific detail for the events since they are not important for the question. Again, 3 is the magic number. Please pick up three things to describe your own leadership style.
